# Unsupervised_learning_model
Here, in this project I have breast cancer related unlabelled and highly dimentional dataset. The task is to cluster the data and find important features and their corresponding values that play a major role in deciding the clusters. There are total 1903 rows and 693 distinct features. The major challenge here being high dimentionallity.
